A bunch of boilerplate Pulumi templates for infra I commonly use. If you're interested in using yourself, follow these
steps:

1. Create an account on pulumi.com and generate a personal access token
2. cd into one of the folders in /src, for example /src/lambda
3. View the readme there on what cloud resources will be generated, and how to spin them up
